When I've worked with React in the past, I've always used it to make things that felt well-suited to React.  Not this time!  I wanted to do something different, so I told myself that whatever thoughts entered my head, I'd try to make them work in React.  Because of that this project is a bit unconventional.  But also because of that, I learned a good deal about React.  By trying to stretch what I could do with React and do things that it likely wasn't intended to do, I ended up in a lot of situations that forced me to gain a deeper understanding of how React actually worked.  I also had a lot of fun.
